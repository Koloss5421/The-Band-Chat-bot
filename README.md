# The-Band-Chat-bot

This is a simple discord bot created for a private server. Simply add your auth token to a file called "auth.json" with the code:
```
{
    "token":"[INSERT TOKEN HERE]"
}
```


The band is pretty simple. We play youtube videos.

=====       Commands:       =====

~add [url]    - Add a song to the playlist. Ex. ~add hxxp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evb31p5vFs4

~skip         - Skip the current playing song - or use to get the bot going again.

~getband      - Call the band to your current voice channel. All you have to do is be in there.

~gohome       - We get the message. We simply go back to the speakeasy for all to hear when the chats are packed.
